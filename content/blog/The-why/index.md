**My aim for this blog is pretty simple: keep an online journal of the lessons I learn.**

The vast majority of my posts will be about any new skills I pick up, struggles I face, wins I celebrate and losses I suffer. This really is intended to be a place for me to refer back to regularly. 

I need to remember how to do a responsive menu? The blog has a post on that. 

How did I do that image carousel? O, I wrote about that the in the blog. 

What does SEO mean? O ya, I wrote about it on the blog.

I just want a place for my notes.

From the simplest “Hello World” in a new language to the wonderful world of API’s, this blog should be able to house all of that. Should be my online storeroom
